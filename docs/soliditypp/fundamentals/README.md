# Introduction

Solidity++ is a programming language for creating smart contracts on the [Vite](https://vite.org) blockchain. Solidity++ is derived from [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) and embraces Solidity's underlying message passing infrastructure. Solidity++ has an asynchronous design that works well with Vite's high-throughput DAG-based ledger.

## Solidity++ Features

- Based on Solidity; easy to learn and to port existing contracts.
- Asynchronous design allows for high throughput on DAG-based blockchains.
- Secure by default against reentrancy and flash-loan attacks.
- Support for native tokens, random numbers, scheduled tasks and more.
- Vite's zero-fee feature (enabled by a [lock-for-quota system](../../vite-basics/quota)) enables new possibilities for dApps.

We assume that you are already familiar with Solidity, if not, please read [Solidity v0.8.x documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0) before starting.
