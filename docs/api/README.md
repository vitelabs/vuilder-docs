# Overview

Each Vite node provides a JSON-RPC API that allows applications to connect to the blockchain. 
Developers can interact with on-chain data and send various types of transactions to the network by utilizing the endpoints provided by the API. 
The API follows the JSON-RPC standard, a stateless, lightweight, remote procedure call (RPC) protocol commonly used when interacting with blockchains.

## Protocol

| JSON-RPC 2.0 | HTTP | Publishâ€“Subscribe | WebSocket |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| &#x2713; | &#x2713; | &#x2713; | &#x2713;|

| Protocol | Default Port |
|:-------:|:------:|
| HTTP | 48132 |
| WebSocket | 41420 |

!!! tip 
    On Vite, **a transaction is equivalent to an account block**. When we mention a transaction, it also refers to an account block, and vice versa.

## Type Conversion
* Bytes (`byte[]`) are converted to a base64 string.
* `hash` is a 32-byte hex string.
* `hex` and `base64` are strings in hex or base64 format.
* For numeric types such as `uint64`, `float`, and `bigint`, when they are suffixed with the `string` type, it means they should be passed as strings.
* `address` and `tokenId` are passed in as strings.

## Common Models

| maxSupply | bigint string | The maximum supply of the token. 0 for non-reissuable tokens |
| isOwnerBurnOnly | bool | `true` means only the token owner can burn the tokens. Deprecated |
| index | uint16 | A number between 0-999 to distinguish tokens with the same symbol |

### `AccountBlock`
|  Name  | Type | Description |

| address| address | Account address |
| publicKey| base64 | Producer's public key |
